# DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.
#
# The version, urls and sha256s below are rewritten on every release by the
# `release` workflow in the private source repo (dennisvr/galvanized), which
# builds the binaries, attaches the tarballs to a Release on this repo, and
# pushes the bump here. Two things that workflow's substitutions depend on:
#   - the version line stays `  version "..."` at two spaces of indent
#   - each sha256 stays 64 lowercase hex chars on the line right after its url
#
# The 0.0.0 placeholders below are what an unreleased tap looks like; the first
# release replaces them.
